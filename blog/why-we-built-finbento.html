    <p>FinBento started as a side project to make financial news a little less chaotic.</p>
    <p>We wanted something bite-sized, clean, and curated — something that wouldn’t scream at us in ALL CAPS every morning. So we built it.</p>
    <p>With calm filters, minimal UI, and a no-nonsense reader mode, FinBento lets you get the news without the noise.</p>
