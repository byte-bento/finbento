  <h1>📊 What Sources We Use</h1>
  <p class="post-meta">📅 July 25, 2025</p>

  <p>One of the most important questions we asked ourselves when building FinBento was: <strong>“Where should the news come from?”</strong></p>

  <p>In a world of constant market noise, TikTok finance bros, and opinionated Reddit threads, we knew we didn’t want FinBento to become just another content firehose. Our goal was to deliver clean, relevant, trustworthy finance news — <em>and nothing extra</em>.</p>

  <h2>📰 Our Core News Sources</h2>

  <p>FinBento currently pulls from a curated list of <strong>12 reliable finance outlets</strong> — selected for their balance of trustworthiness, clarity, and signal-to-noise ratio:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bloomberg</strong> — Trusted for global markets, economic insight, and sharp analysis (though sometimes behind a paywall).</li>
    <li><strong>CNBC</strong> — Real-time business news and fast-moving headlines. We surface only the clearest, most useful bits.</li>
    <li><strong>Financial Times</strong> — Great for international economic context and deeper dives into policy, though often paywalled.</li>
    <li><strong>Fortune</strong> — Business news with a human angle — startups, leadership, tech, and the money behind the headlines.</li>
    <li><strong>Investing</strong> — Broad coverage of macroeconomic trends, commodities, and investing analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Investopedia</strong> — Definitions, explainers, and occasional news — excellent for newer investors and reference seekers.</li>
    <li><strong>Kiplinger</strong> — Practical personal finance coverage: taxes, saving, retirement, and financial literacy.</li>
    <li><strong>MarketWatch</strong> — Bread-and-butter finance updates: earnings, stock moves, and economic reports.</li>
    <li><strong>Motley Fool</strong> — Occasionally opinionated, but a solid pulse-check on what individual investors are thinking.</li>
    <li><strong>Seeking Alpha</strong> — Analyst insights and earnings recaps with both bullish and bearish takes.</li>
    <li><strong>WSJ (Wall Street Journal)</strong> — Industry gold standard for reporting — we link it, even if it’s sometimes paywalled.</li>
    <li><strong>Yahoo Finance</strong> — General market summaries, charts, and headline recaps — great for quick context.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚫 What We Don’t Include (Yet)</h2>

  <p>We love a good Reddit deep dive as much as the next person, but we’ve chosen to avoid sources that are <strong>low-signal, overly biased, or difficult to parse reliably</strong>. That includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reddit or Twitter threads (too unstructured… for now)</li>
    <li>Benzinga, ZeroHedge, or sites with high ad-to-content ratios</li>
    <li>Clickbait-heavy outlets or ones dominated by sponsored content</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We may explore ways to add community-sourced insight later — but only if we can do it in a way that <strong>preserves FinBento’s clarity-first experience</strong>.</p>

  <h2>🔭 What’s Next</h2>

  <p>We plan to expand our source list slowly and deliberately. If we add a new feed, it’ll be because it brings value — not just volume.</p>

  <p>Some future ideas we’re exploring:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🧱 A toggle to hide paywalled sources</li>
    <li>💬 Source strength indicators or reliability tags</li>
    <li>🧩 More filtering options by category or region</li>
    <li>🤝 Integrations with finance APIs or public datasets</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Have a trusted source you’d love to see in FinBento? <strong>Let us know</strong> — submit an issue on <a href="https://github.com/byte-bento/finbento/issues/new">GitHub</a> or DM us on <a href="https://x.com/byte_bento">Twitter/X</a>.</p>

  <h2>💡 In Summary</h2>

  <p>FinBento is designed to be small, calm, and helpful. That starts with surfacing headlines that matter — not just whatever’s trending.</p>

  <p>We’re committed to keeping things lean, focused, and transparent. Thanks for trusting us to help you stay informed.</p>
